    <h2> A SHORT BIO </h2>
      <p>The Barasingha, also known as the 'swamp deer' is found in India, as well as Nepal, and other Indian subcontinents. 
        The reason I chose this animal in particular, however, is due to the fact that it has been exterpated in places like Bangladesh and Pakistan. 
        Though few in numbers, these beautiful deer-like species have been conserved in places like Kanha National Park and Tiger Reserve (KNPTR) 
        where there numbers are about 800 as of the year 2020. One can only hope that these numbers continue to expand, for all three sub-species of the Barasingha.</p>
