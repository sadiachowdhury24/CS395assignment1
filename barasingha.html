    <h2> A SHORT BIO </h2>
      <p>The Barasingha, also known as the 'swamp deer' is found in India, as well as Nepal, and other Indian subcontinents. 
        The reason I chose this animal in particular, however, is due to the fact that it has been extirpated in places like Bangladesh and Pakistan. 
        Though few in numbers, these beautiful deer-like species have been conserved in places like Kanha National Park and Tiger Reserve (KNPTR) 
        where their numbers are about 800 as of the year 2020. Overall, the Barasingha population is about 3,500-5,100, each with a lifespan of around 20-23 years. 
        One can only hope that these numbers continue to expand, for all three sub-species of the Barasingha.

    <h3>HABITAT & HABITS</h3>
      <p> As aforementioned, there are three sub-species of Barasinghas. 
        Wetland Barasinghas inhabit India and Nepal, Hard-ground Barasinghas inhabit Madhya Pardesh in India, and Eastern Barasinghas inhabit Assam in north-eastern India.
        There is only one population each of the latter two sub-species, which contributes to the fact that they are a vunerable species.
        It also definetely does not help that the species was extirpated in the past.
        However, there are people in the Barasinghas' habitat(s) who are trying their best to conserve and ultimately save the species from being endangered.</p>
      <p> Barasinghas are known for their beautiful antlers, which shed and regrow annually. Barasingha itself means 'twelve-tined'- a very fitting name.
         They are also known to stick together in groups of 10-20, led by a female, and they are known to stay close to water. Barasinghas feast on grass and leaves- a particularly herbivorous/folivorous diet. 
        These social animals are mainly docile, and like to spend their afternoons resting together. </p>

    <h4>DECREASING NUMBERS</h4>
      <p>I really want to emphasize that the Barasinghas' population size is constantly decreasing, and in dire need of attention. They suffer from deforestation, as it destroys their habitats,
        as well as swamp/marsh drainage due to agricultural needs, and even diseases carried by domestic cattle. To make matters worse, they are hunted for their beautiful antlers. 
        A more natural decrease to their numbers is that they fall prey to animals such as Tigers and Leopards. 
        It is no wonder that the Rucervus Duvaucelii (Barasinghas' scientific name) are labeled as vulnerable (VU) 
        on the The International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species (IUCN red list.)
