      King of the mountains. These legendary big cats reside in the high elevation terrain of the Eastern Himalayas.
      Their hind legs give these animals the ability to leap six times the length 
      of their bodies. Their long tails provide balance and agility and their powerful builds allow them to scale steep 
      slopes with ease. Snow Leopards normally live 15-18 years in the wild; however, they are an engangered species due 
      to poaching and habitat destruction. An interesting fact about snow leopards is they are the inspiration behind the main anatognist,
      "Tai Lung", in the movie "Kung Fu Panda". Tai Lung was a muscular snow leopard with supernatural strength.
