    <!-- Description of Bengal Fox - how they behave, what they eat and how they communicate -->
    <h2> Description </h2>
      <p>
        The Bengal Fox is a kind of endemic Asian foxes for the Indian subcontinent. Its large, thick and black tail is its most important feature, which represents up to 60% of your body's length. Usually, the queue queues behind, but when the fox is running, takes the tail horizontally, then it takes vertically doing sudden revs. The color of the Fox layer varies according to the season and inside a population, but it is usually gray on the back and pale in the belly, with dark brown on the  ears, with black edges.Their ears are great compared to their body and are possibly an adaptation for thermoregulation in their hot and dry habitats.

    <!-- How they behave -->
    <h2>Behavior and Ecology</h2>
      <p>
        Bengal foxes hide under plants or in subterranean burrows that they dig during the day.
        Dens are typically large and complicated, with multiple chambers and escape routes.
        Around sunrise or sunset, they can be spotted basking at a vantage position. Their life expectancy is approximately 6 to 8 years.
      </p>

     <!-- What they eat -->
    <h2>Diet</h2>
      <p>
        Rodents, reptiles, crabs, termites, insects, small birds, and fruits are among the Bengal fox's favorite foods.
        Scats of young pups appeared to show that they fed mainly on rodents but are opportunistic feeders..

    <!-- how they communicate -->
    <h2>Communication</h2>
      <p>
        Foxes use a variety of vocalizations to communicate. The most common call is a chattering cry.
        They also bark, growl, and whimper. They can be heard howling in bunches late at night.
      </p>

    <!-- how they reproduce -->
    <h2>Breeding</h2>
      <p>
        Bengal foxes only reproduce once a year, between the months of December and January.
        Three to six young are born in a den after a gestation period of 51 to 53 days. Both parents assist in the raising of the children, who are weaned at the age of one month.
        At 4 to 5 months of age, young foxes become self-sufficient, and at 1 to 2 years of age, they attain sexual maturity.
