    <h2>Brief Description About Bengal Fox</h2>
    <p>The Bengal Fox is a kind of endemic Asian foxes for the Indian subcontinent. Its large, thick and black tail is its most important feature, which represents up to 60% of your body's length. Usually, the queue queues behind, but when the fox is running, takes the tail horizontally, then it takes vertically doing sudden revs. The color of the Fox layer varies according to the season and inside a population, but it is usually gray on the back and pale in the belly, with dark brown on the ears, with black edges.  Their ears are great compared to their body and are possibly an adaptation for thermoregulation in their hot and dry habitats. </p>
